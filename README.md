Our Development team’s main focus was to make this plugin more easy to use and customize.So we have designed this plugin in a way that only one step can reach your requirements.You just have to go to product page->Edit->Set try on image. That’s it. It will automatically render a try on button on that product.

To render try on button on any product detail page you will have to set a try on image via product edit page or create new product page.This try on image is a simple front facing view of your jewellery product.This should be a transparent image.Image dimensions and guide to make a perfect Try On image is available at Product edit page only.
